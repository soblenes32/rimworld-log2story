# rimworld-log2story

## Overview

This repository is a small experiment for turning Rimworld gameplay logs into a novella. The workflow will rely on Jupyter notebooks and a large language model to automatically generate a narrative from the collected logs.

## Getting Started

1. Install Python 3.8 or newer.
2. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Launch Jupyter and open the provided notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

You can then step through the notebook to parse logs, feed them to the LLM, and produce story text.

## Project Status

This is an early prototype intended to explore approaches for generating longer form text from gameplay logs. Contributions and suggestions are welcome!
